# Git Setup
This is my first time ever using git, I setup git in ubuntu linux through WSL. First i opened CMD in the desktop folder, then executed these commands:

wsl

sudo apt install git

git init

git clone https://github.com/MrCbrue/CyberSecurity.git

cd Linux-Notes

touch GitSetup.md

All of this created a folder identical to the GitHub repo https://github.com/MrCbrue/CyberSecurity.git. And I created this file (GitSetup.md). Once I am done writing this file i will save it and execute the following commands:

git add .

git commit -m "Added GitSetup.md 1/18/2026"

git push

This will commit the changes made (adding this file) and save them to the github repo.
